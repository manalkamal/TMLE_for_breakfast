This is a two day meeting gathering the statisticians of the REDDIE
work package. The course is generally about using modern causal
inference to emulate a hypothetical trial into register data, and
specifically about how to use LTMLE for the analysis of the such a
hypothetical trial. The meeting schedules a series of 20 minute long
lectures which are interrupted by R practicals using simulated
data. There is plenty of time for group and subgroup discussions.

The meeting will take place at Ã˜sterfarimagsgade 5, 1014 Copenhagen in
room CSS 7.0.8.
