* Download the repository

If you have =git= installed on your computer, clone the repository
from github, conveniently directly from Rstudio by creating a new
project (File -> New Project) from Version Control with Reposity URL:

https://github.com/tagteam/TMLE_for_breakfast

Alternatively, you can clone the repo from a terminal 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git@github.com:tagteam/TMLE_for_breakfast.git
#+END_SRC

Otherwise, if you do not have =git= installed, download the zip
archive with all files from

https://github.com/tagteam/TMLE_for_breakfast/tree/main

Then, create a new Rstudio project in the unpacked folder.
